# NextJS portfolio Hosting

I hosted my [portfolio](http://portfolio-9715.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/) using s3 static website hosting.

NextJS advance features like Image Optimization cannot be used when using next export.

Hence we need to remove those dependencies and use 'next-optimized-images' module for the same purpose.
