# NextJS portfolio Hosting

I hosted my [portfolio](https://iharshit.site) serverlessly on AWS using AWS CDK.

NextJS advance features like Image Optimization cannot be used when using next export.

Hence we need to remove those dependencies and use 'next-optimized-images' module for the same purpose.
