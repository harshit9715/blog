## A something about me first ü§∏

- I ~~love~~ live problem-solving.üîß
- I love automation.üèóÔ∏è
- I like writing pythonüêç scripts, bash scripts, and google app scripts.
- I am a "Never Say Never" kind of person, who is always looking for contributing and helping anyone who reaches out.
- I love to be understood, often because of this my colleagues and friends say that I can be a good teacher or instructor. I am okay with taking 10 extra steps for explaining a problem/theory/solution to its core. Not just to solve a problem but understand why it occurred in the first place.
- This list is becoming long so, I am planning to come up with a timeline-like design.

## This is where it starts

### First Year

- Deployed a PHP application [MRBS](https://mrbs.sourceforge.io/demo.php), not really used since we had a solution from [google suite](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1686462?hl=en)
- worked with [processing](https://processing.org/) and understood "how-to programming".üñ•Ô∏è
- Worked on genetic algorithms (Darwinism)
- Worked on [Edge-ML](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-machine-learning-on-the-edge-92fac32105e6) using raspberry and intel-neural-compute-stick and built 5 class image classification model.
- Worked with spaCy (open-source NLP) and built a model with 26% accuracy for an open challenge. (I know it's low, best achieved was 34%... bring this up and we will talk about the problem statement and possible solutions that we could have done.)
- I have good hands-on with python, Jupiter notebooks. (Sometimes I use Jupyter while developing scripts as well, it reduces development time.)
- Worked on the serverless backend using AWS and Chalice framework. (My first intro to backend and API building, up until this point.. the word API gave me chills.)
- Worked on Cloud Resource Provisioning (Jenkins, Terraform, and Cloud-CLI tools)
- Worked with Angular as well for better communicating with UI devs.

### Second Year

- Worked with Stripe payments APIs for accepting payments.
- Worked on AWS Lambda function as serverless computing. (Yes! without even working on server-based backends.)
- Worked on DynamoDB and started designing NoSQL queries. (I write more efficient queries now.)
- Worked on data modeling. (One table for 1 application and manage everything through queries.)
- AWS Cognito based Authentication and Authorization (Welcome to OAuth)
- Worked with 3rd party integrations such as [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/), [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-in) for personal project and so many more for my company projects.
- Participated in a house hackathon and worked on backend and a React-Native app (we built a secure server-side face recognition authentication system, with just a simple trick.) Congratulations, team! (@dhana, @Swathi, @Anjaneya) We got the 2nd price. üëë
- Started GraphQL (because we don't need Lambda's for basic CRUD operations.)
- Knows how to write [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) documentations. üìù
- Worked on static website hosting. (are you still deploying swagger in EBS ?)
- Designed and built the infrastructure for a Contact tracing application like aarogya setu (failed twice due to heavy egress charges, they say third time is a charm.)
- Introduction to google app scripts for automating day-to-day tasks.
- Worked on integrating [Decentralized Identity](https://identity.foundation/) Management solution (Blockchain)
- Built a ticketing system app. An e-pass for office access using AWS serverless and React-native.
- Finally, worked on NodeJS express server application and Heroku deployment.
- Worked with [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) database (best-in-class distributed database with almost linear scalability.), _I am a certified associate developer and DBA for cassandra._
- Jenkins, I have worked with **Jenkins**, agents, jobs, pipelines, CI/CD.
- I have worked with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as well. (Automation phase 3, that's what they call it.)
- I worked with **React** to finish my journey as a full-stack dev.
- After completing that, I started writing this blog.
- I built my [API Resume](https://portfolio-9715.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myRes.json) and hosted it on 4 different places as **OpenAPI Docs**.
- I worked with FastAPIs for building Python APIs.
- I worked with **oAuth**, federated signin and JWTs for authentications. (Who is _Mr. Identity_?)
- I am exploring **AWS-CDK** very closely these days, apart from setting up **AWS-SAM** local testing.

### Also

- Can build durable cloud functions. (Serverless orchestrations!)
- Can do data manipulations in Azure data factory.
- I have worked with [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/). (I prefer [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) though!)
- I have worked with Socket.io to build a real-time chat application.
- I have built a chatbot using google dialogue flow. (It's called [SecretSanta BotüéÖ](https://t.me/SecretSantaHelperBot) and it's available on telegram)

## My mentors

Thanks, [@waseem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdwaseem/), you found me in the crowd, understood my skills gave me the right track, introduced me to¬†the right people, and give me the career boost I needed. You are one of the best people I have worked with. Your leadership is inspirational.

Thanks, [@dhana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-s-s-r-dhanapathi-marepalli-24716b92/), for being the mentor and the lead I needed. You taught me how to chase perfection and how to break down complex problems. One of the key things I that you taught me was the importance of "naming convention" and writing documentation. You pushed me for my first tech talk. I will always be grateful to you for my communication and teamwork skills. ¬†(Break it until you make it, DRY, TDD).

Thanks, [@sanjay sir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjaysi/) for recognizing my potential, when I was just a college guy and making me a part of our [@Atmecs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atmecs-inc/) family.
