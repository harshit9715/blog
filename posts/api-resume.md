## Motivation

It's not easy for a backend developers to show off their skills. Since there is no UI generally to show their work (duh..)

I set out on a mission to build my API resume and for the people who prefers more interactive things than looking at a JSON object, I added a swagger UI to it.

## Links

- You can check out the raw (JSON) version [here](https://portfolio-9715.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myRes.json).

- If you are more of a look-n-feel person, then check out [this one](http://portfolio-9715.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/docs/).

- If you love postman, and test the APIs via postman, [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8553846/TzJx9cWc) you go.

- If you like to keep everything with source code, I still got you covered. I have deployed it at [github pages](https://harshit9715.github.io/blog/) as well.

## Why static host it?

You will be surprised to know that not many people know about this and generally host their swagger using a server. (like, express server and EBS.) **Which is usually 25x more costlier.**

There could be resons to do so, but I couldn't find many since Swagger isin't generally the actual product. (Unless you are a B2B company)

Thanks for dropping and I hope you found this useful.
And If you want to know more about static website host.
